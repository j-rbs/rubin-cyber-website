    <h1>Cybersecurity Posture Assessment &amp; Roadmap</h1>
    <p class="muted">
      A focused review of where you stand today — and a realistic roadmap for the next 6–12 months,
      grounded in how your business actually runs.

    <h2>What this engagement does</h2>
    <p>
      This assessment is designed for growing organisations that want clarity: 
      <strong>Where are we now, what are our real risks, and what should we actually do next?</strong> 
      Rather than dumping a generic checklist on you, I focus on your environment, your people,
      and the decisions you’re making as a business.
    </p>

    <h3>What I look at</h3>
    <ul class="indented-list">
      <li><strong>Governance &amp; decision-making:</strong> how risk is discussed, who owns what, and where security fits today.</li>
      <li><strong>Identity &amp; access:</strong> accounts, MFA coverage, admin access, and basic access hygiene.</li>
      <li><strong>Data:</strong> what you hold, where it lives, and how it’s protected and backed up.</li>
      <li><strong>Infrastructure &amp; SaaS:</strong> key systems, cloud services and how they’re configured at a practical level.</li>
      <li><strong>People &amp; awareness:</strong> how staff are supported to recognise and handle everyday risks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What you walk away with</h3>
    <ul class="indented-list">
      <li>A clear, non-jargony summary of your current security posture.</li>
      <li>A risk register that links issues to business impact, not just technical details.</li>
      <li>An asset and data view that’s maintainable, not a one-off spreadsheet that gets abandoned.</li>
      <li>
        A <strong>prioritised roadmap</strong> of improvements, grouped by effort and impact —
        so you know what to do now, next, and later.
      </li>
      <li>Time with me to walk through the findings and ask questions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mono">Fixed fee · typically ~2 weeks from kickoff</p>

    <h3>Who this is for</h3>
    <ul class="indented-list">
      <li>Small and mid-sized businesses who’ve “done some basics” but want a clearer picture.</li>
      <li>Leaders getting ready for growth, audits, board conversations or new markets.</li>
      <li>Teams that don’t need a full-time security lead, but do want credible guidance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you already have tooling in place, this assessment will help you get more value from it.
      If you don’t, we’ll focus on principles and options rather than pushing specific vendors.
    </p>

    <p class="mono">Next step: short intro call to confirm scope and fit.</p>
